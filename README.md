# MLLearningScripts
Notes and project I made while learning ML algorithms.
1. Perceptron ML implementation.ipynb file has implementation of Python Perceptron algorythm described by Sebastian Raschka in his book "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn" on the Iris dataset.
I decided to try it on the Kaggle Titanic dataset as well. 
Plot Twist - this model failed to learn and predict if the person survives on the Titanic, based on parameters "Age", "PassengerClass", "Fare".
