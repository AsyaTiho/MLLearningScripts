# MLLearningScripts
Notes and project I made while learning some ML algorithms.
>>> Perceptron ML implementation.ipynb file has implementation of Perceptron algorythm described by Sebastian Raschka in his book "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn on the Iris dataset and Kaggle Titanic dataset. 
Plot Twist - this model could learn and predict if the person survives on the Titanic!
